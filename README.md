# CC-Plethora-Scripts

A bunch of personal CC:Tweaked + Plethora scripts tested on Enigmatica 2: Expert

## How to install this on computercraft

Note: This assumes the repo is cloned on the root of your computer, please change your paths accordingly.

### 1. Install Github Repo Downloader

this will add the github program and it's rom to the computer

```sh
pastebin run p8PJVxC4
```

I also have the habit to alias github as git as such:

```sh
alias git github
```

### 2. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone helldragger/CC-Plethora-Scripts
```

This will clone the whole repo into a CC-Plethora-Scripts directory.

### 3. Update the repo

While being in the repository directory, use the pull script to update it

```sh
pull
```

## The various scripts

### pull -- updater

This script is an updater, it auto clones the repo onto itself using the github script aforementioned.

### fly -- self-explanatory (WIP)

This script is an attempt to emulate creative flight, but using the Neural Interface ```.launch(yaw, pitch, power)``` function as propulsion system!
You can see an example of me trying to balance the thrusting power [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfzn9IO32pM&lc=z231tliztsbbcnoys04t1aokg4vtpt0nkz3c4uxpojgbbk0h00410)

As of fly MK.III, the controls are:

- W : pitch up
- S : pitch down
- Space : thrust up
- LeftShift : thrust down
- , : shift down the speed mode
- . : shift up the speed mode
- double space : start / stop fly mode

You can see a demo [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCgeY8SNuOk&feature=youtu.be)
